# How Can I Help?
This applicaiton will be a tool to connect people. The people we want to connect are in two categories, the Donors and the Recepients. Donors are the ones 
who have goods or rescources they are willing to give to anyone who needs them for free. The Recipients are the ones who need some help and they want the 
goods and services provided by Donors. There are many apps that connect people, but none that focus so heavily on helping the community  and donating time 
to help your fellow neighbors. The effects of this application could be an increased awareness in the deficiencies in neighborhoods as well as increasing 
public service.

# Personas
### Persona 1: 
Smith, age 67, a retired factory line worker. He lives with his wife, age 66. They live in a townhouse in a suburb. Both of them did not have college education but finished their high school and worked in factory related jobs from then. They could handle technology to manage all their needs for life. Smith is always active, able to do all the work at home despite his age. But he fell sick and didn't have much energy for some time to finish the work. The grass in the lawn is ready to be cut. So they are looking for someone who could lend help to cut the grass in the lawn this time. They are ready to pay for the help but do not know who to contact for this but just need some domestic, personal help and do not want to contact big parties for this. 
### Persona 2: 
Joanna, age 30, holds a bachelor's degree in psychology. She lives in Los Angeles and is working as a therapist and counselor for children who have special needs. She enjoys doing this work, but she understands that it can be expensive and difficult for some parents to afford her normal day rates. This is why she has signed up for “How Can I Help?” to provide some care to families who do not have the resources to meet her regularly. She can only use the app in her free time, so she has a schedule on the app for when she is free and people can request to meet with her through the app. This app has helped connect her with many children who are now doing better in life with her occasional counseling sessions. 
### Persona 3: 
Heather, age 28, high school education. was recently evicted from her apartment in the city because she could not afford to pay the rent. This was due to her losing her job related to an ongoing crisis around the globe.  She now lives in a tent somewhere in the city, many others suffer a similar fate. She is running low on money, but she needs to eat. She uses the How Can I Help app to look for anyone who is donating food items for people stuck in an unfortunate situation such as hers. 
### Persona 4: 
Sam, age 25, currently lives in Pennsylvania. He recently accepted a big job offer and is expected to move to Florida soon for his new job as a software developer. Excited with his new chapter in life, he makes time to move out of his apartment. Although he doesn’t carry a lot of house items, he has an obsession of keeping a lot of clothes, but when he is unable to keep all his clothes he makes a quick decision to donate them. Sam also chooses to donate because he wants to consider donating winter clothes to those in need, since he won’t need them while at his new job. Sam uses the How Can I Help app to look for individuals or services that are actively seeking donations for new clothes; this is also helpful because, despite being in a rush, he is able to quickly communicate with those in need, on one place, without having to spend so much time researching services that may or may not accept clothes. Sam is familiar with technology given his background and is able to manage with the app.
